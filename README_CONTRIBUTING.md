# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute!

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
3. Make changes and add tests if appropriate
4. Submit a PR with a clear description

## Code style
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write comments for any non-obvious logic
- Add docs in `docs/` for architectural or API changes

## Notes
This starter repo is a scaffold. Before merging production changes, ensure security review (especially wallet/auth code) and audits for any smart contracts.
