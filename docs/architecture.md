# Architecture Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture for a componentized Web3 app (Endless-like).

## Layers
1. **Frontend (components)**:
   - Auth component (Google, wallet)
   - Wallet component (connect, sign, payGas)
   - UI components: identity, storage uploader, marketplace widgets

2. **Backend / Gateway**:
   - REST API or GraphQL to manage sessions, sign meta-transactions, and interact with off-chain services
   - Relayer for meta-transactions (developer-paid gas)
   - Integration with AI services (model hosting, inference API)

3. **Blockchain Layer**:
   - Public chain (Move or EVM) for on-chain state and token actions
   - Cross-chain bridges (if needed)
   - Smart contracts to manage components, permissions, and tokenomics

4. **Storage & CDN**:
   - Decentralized storage (IPFS, Arweave) for content
   - CDN for fast static delivery

5. **AI Layer**:
   - Model storage, on-chain references to model metadata
   - Incentive mechanisms for data / model contributions

## Component marketplace idea
- Components are packaged UI + API contract; developers can discover, import, and run components with minimal wiring.

## Security considerations
- Never store private keys on server
- Use signed nonces for wallet auth
- Audit smart contracts and relayer services
